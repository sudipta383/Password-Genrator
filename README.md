## Note

This is a simple example for password generator, for production use additional security considerations are needed like salting and hashing passwords and handling password strength.

You can also use more secure random generator like SecureRandom instead of simple random generator used in this example.

Please make sure to use strong and unique passwords for your accounts, you can use this generator as a tool but not as a replacement for good password practices.
